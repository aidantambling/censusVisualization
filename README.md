Key features:
1. View data in quartiles or in halves, set by adjustable threshold slider
2. View data in pure counts or as percentages
3. Make different API calls according to selected dataset
4. Datasets sorted according to category, accessible as such


Planned features(?):
1. State view / national view
2. Use web scraping to expand dataset access beyond manual selection
3. County view: select an individual county, view all other counties as less than / greater than
4. County view: select two counties and observe how they relate for the given dataset
5. Minor GUI adjustments and minor fixes (Highlight the dataset category. Make next and prev as arrows, and make them dull if their end has been reached. remove the pop up bar when category is changed)
6. Migrate to react? Desirable but hard (imo) to reconcile D3 (basis of program) with React DOM policies.
